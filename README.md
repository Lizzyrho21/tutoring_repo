Tutoring repo for zoom 

## Welcome to the tutoring repo. I will be pushing some exercises in here for you all to help you practice with the concepts in the tutoring session

- For today, (01/14/2022), I have two exercises below for you to complete.

- I have already wired up the JS file to the HTML file, so you can write your code and view it on the terminal in your browser (Open up HTML file, right-click on browser, and open developer tools. You will see a tab that says 'console'. PSA:: THIS 'CONSOLE.LOG' TECHNIQUE IS HOW YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHECK YOUR WORK)

- Please attempt as best as you can on these exercises and make COMMENTS in your JS file. I want to see your thought process, and it will help you become a better developer. Also, if you don't know a concept or keyword. Look it up on Google or whatever search tool you use. This is a learning process!

## ARRAY AND LOOPS EXERCISES

The two exercises below will test your strength on arrays and loops. It's your job to figure out where to use the loop. (HINT: A 'for' loop will do the trick).


let myAlphabet = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D','E','F', 'G'];

- What is the length of the array?
- Write a function called myAlphabetLength which console.logs the length of the array
- Within the function also use an if-conditional statement that checks if the number of items within the array are less than 4



2. 
- Declare and initialize an array called Planets with 5 string values
- console.log each item in the array
- Also console.log the index in each iteration
